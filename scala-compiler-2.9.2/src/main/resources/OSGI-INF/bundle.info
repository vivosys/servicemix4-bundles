\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise,
    elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages, enabling
    Java and other programmers to be more productive. Code sizes are typically reduced by a factor of two to three when
    compared to an equivalent Java application.
